test 1 - REC 001 and OUT 001

A steady tone was recorded using the I²S microphone, processed through the FPGA pitch-shift pipeline, and written to SD. MATLAB analysis showed:

Original dominant frequency: ~808.6 Hz

Shifted dominant frequency: ~691.4 Hz

Pitch ratio: 0.855

Semitone change: –2.71 semitones (downward)

SNR and THD remained stable(SNR and THD essentially remained unchanged, meaning there is little distortion and the pitch shifting algorithm preserves audio quality)

SNR: 29.67 dB → 31.62 dB

THD: –19.30 dB → –19.47 dB

Audacity spectrum plots visually confirmed that the peak frequency moved downward, and the spectrogram shows harmonics compressed in the expected direction.
Conclusion: The FPGA successfully applied a clean downward pitch shift without degrading audio quality.
