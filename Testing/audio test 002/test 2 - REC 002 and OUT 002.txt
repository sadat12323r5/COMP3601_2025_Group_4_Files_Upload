test 2 - REC 002 and OUT 002

A steady tone was recorded using the I²S microphone, processed through the FPGA pitch-shift pipeline, and written to SD. MATLAB analysis showed:

Original dominant frequency: ~316.41 Hz

Shifted dominant frequency: ~339.4 Hz

Pitch ratio: 1.074

Semitone change: +1.024 semitones (downward)

SNR and THD remained stable(SNR and THD essentially remained unchanged, meaning there is little distortion and the pitch shifting algorithm preserves audio quality)

SNR: 27.02 dB → 27.83 dB

THD: –24.00 dB → –24.23 dB

Audacity waveform and spectral analysis confirmed a clear upward shift in pitch while maintaining signal clarity.
Conclusion: The pipeline correctly applied an upward pitch modification, again with minimal noise or distortion added.
